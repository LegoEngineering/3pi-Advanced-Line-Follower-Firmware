# 3pi-Advanced-Line-Follower-Firmware

#The purpose of this project is to create line follower software from scratch. 
#The code draws upon fundamental data provided in the data sheets of the hardware.
#This version is not only capable of following one-inch thick lines of electrical tape, 
it isable to do so at extremely sharp turns with diameters less than half the width of the robot itself.
#The robot can also successfully navigate continuous gaps of a line and reconnect with the track on the other end.
